# Image_Editor_using_javascript
In this project, we will be creating a Simple Image Editor that can be used to adjust the image values like brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, grayscale and sepia.
Using a combination of various values, one can give an image a completely new look. We will be doing all this in-browser using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the
Canvas API making the application lightweight and fast.
