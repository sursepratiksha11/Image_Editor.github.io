# Image_Editor_using_javascript
In this project, we will be creating a Simple Image Editor that can be used to adjust the image values like brightness, contrast, hue, saturation, grayscale and sepia. Image editors allow one to quickly edit pictures after they have been captured for enhancing them or completely changing their look of Image. Using a combination of various values, one can give an image a completely new look. We will be doing all this in-browser using only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Canvas API making the application lightweight and fast
